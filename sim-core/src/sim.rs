// The deterministic simulation core: everything that decides where the ship
// goes lives here, advanced exclusively in fixed PHYSICS_DT ticks driven by
// a quantized per-tick InputState. The renderer/main loop supplies inputs
// and reads state; it never touches forces, fuel, damage or colliders.
//
// Determinism contract: given the same initial Keyframe and the same
// sequence of InputState per tick, `Sim` reproduces the same trajectory
// bit-for-bit (same binary). Everything that feeds physics is tick-driven:
// - forces/torques are recomputed and applied every tick from the input
//   (previously they were set once per render frame and persisted across
//   substeps — the sim outcome depended on display refresh rate);
// - fuel burn, hull damage, landing timers and pad refuel/repair advance by
//   PHYSICS_DT, not frame time;
// - the collider sliding windows are keyed off the TRUE body position (the
//   render camera adds interpolation + screen shake) and are stored in
//   BTreeMaps so insertion/removal order — and therefore Rapier handle
//   assignment and solver iteration order — is identical across runs;
// - window syncs happen inside tick(), only when the ship's (segment,
//   layer) changes, so live play and resim perform the identical operation
//   sequence at the identical ticks.
// `resim()` re-runs a hybrid Recording through a fresh Sim, which is what
// makes recorded runs verifiable and shareable as pure input streams.
